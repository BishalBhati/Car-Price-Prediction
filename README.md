# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
The **Car Price Prediction** project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the price of a car based on various factors such as model, brand, year of manufacture, engine size, mileage, fuel type, and other specifications. By analyzing historical car pricing data, the model can generate an estimated price for used and new cars.

This project is useful for buyers, sellers, and automobile dealers to make informed decisions about car pricing based on market trends and car features.

## Features
- **Accurate price predictions** using advanced machine learning algorithms
- **Data preprocessing and cleaning** for better prediction accuracy
- **Feature engineering** to select the most relevant car attributes
- **Multiple machine learning models** compared to determine the best approach
- **Web-based user interface** (optional) for interactive price estimation
- **Integration with real-world car price datasets**
- **Scalability** for future improvements and additional features

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost
- **Data Handling & Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Model Deployment**: Flask (for API), Streamlit (for UI)
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL (optional for storing car price data)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy (if needed for dataset collection)

## Dataset
The dataset used for training includes multiple features such as:
- **Car brand and model**
- **Manufacturing year**
- **Mileage (km/l or mpg)**
- **Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid, etc.)**
- **Transmission type (Manual, Automatic, CVT, etc.)**
- **Engine size and power (CC, BHP, etc.)**
- **Number of previous owners**
- **Location (Region-based price variation)**
- **Current market demand (if available)**

The dataset can be sourced from online car selling platforms, Kaggle datasets, or government vehicle databases.

## Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps:
1. **Handling missing values** - Filling or removing incomplete records
2. **Encoding categorical variables** - Converting text data (e.g., brand names) into numerical representations
3. **Feature scaling** - Normalizing numerical features for better model performance
4. **Outlier detection and removal** - Eliminating extreme values that can distort predictions
5. **Data splitting** - Dividing data into training and testing sets (typically 80-20 or 70-30 split)

## Model Selection
Multiple machine learning models are evaluated to find the best-performing one. The models include:
- **Linear Regression** - For understanding how each feature contributes to car price
- **Random Forest Regressor** - Handles complex relationships and reduces overfitting
- **Decision Tree Regressor** - Simple and interpretable model
- **XGBoost Regressor** - Optimized boosting algorithm for better accuracy

### Model Evaluation Metrics
To assess model performance, various evaluation metrics are used:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-Squared Score (R²)**

## Web Application (Optional)
To enhance usability, the model can be deployed as a web application using **Flask** or **Streamlit**, allowing users to enter car details and get an estimated price instantly.

### Steps to Deploy
1. **Train the machine learning model** and save it using `joblib` or `pickle`
2. **Create a Flask API** that accepts car details and returns the predicted price
3. **Build a front-end UI** with Streamlit or React for user interaction
4. **Deploy the application** on **Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud**
